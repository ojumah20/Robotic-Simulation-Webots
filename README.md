# Simulating Autonomous Exploration and Object Detection with an E-puck Robot in Webots
A robotic simulation of an epluck robot in an industrial enviroment trained to indetify objects that are red in colour and avoid obstacles.
This project presents a robotic simulation showcasing the capabilities of an e-puck robot in a
virtual environment. The robot autonomously explores, avoids obstacles, and detects objects by
color. Equipped with distance/proximity sensors, it safely navigates by adjusting motor speeds to
avoid collisions. The camera sensor enables object detection, specifically red-colored objects, with
images saved for analysis. 
The project has practical applications in search and rescue operations.
